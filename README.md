############ STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION #############

This webapp was build by myself, Andrew Turk, as a Master's thesis presentation. It was made with assistance from ChatGPT, Anthropic Claude, and Google Gemini. The goal of this webapp is to provide enough information about Large Language Model technology, also known as, LLM technology so that a person from any background can get up to speed about the current state of this technology, as of april 2024. Research in LLM technology is advancing exponentially fast, with significant news being released every 8 hours, as opposed to once every week or once every month, as it was in 2022-2023. This knowledge graph about large language model technology serves as a form of crash-course and was made with lawmakers, educators, students, businesses, and managers in mind. It is important and will be increasingly important for everyone to be able to have an informed discussion about LLM technology, and I hope this Knowledge Graph will help us get there. Hope you enjoy it!
